Running a Python script in Linux is straightforward, but there are a few things you need to check or do to ensure it works smoothly. Here's a step-by-step guide for running a Python script on a Linux system.

Step 1: Check if Python is Installed
First, ensure that Python is installed on your Linux system. Most modern Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. You can check if Python is installed by running:

python --version or python3 --version
If python returns a version number, it means Python is installed (typically Python 2.x).
If python3 returns a version number, Python 3.x is installed.
